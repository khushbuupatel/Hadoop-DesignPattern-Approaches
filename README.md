## Hadoop-DesignPattern-Approaches
This repository contains the "pairs" and "stripes" approach design patterns to calculate the co-occurrence matrix for word-pair frequency count and relative word-pair frequency count.

### Pairs Approach
  - Part 1: Demonstrates the code for calculating the co-occurrence matrix for word-pair frequency count
  - Part 2: Demonstrates the code for calculating the co-occurrence matrix for relative word-pair frequency count

### Stripes Approach
  - Part 1: Demonstrates the code for calculating the co-occurrence matrix for word-pair frequency count
  - Part 2: Demonstrates the code for calculating the co-occurrence matrix for relative word-pair frequency count
